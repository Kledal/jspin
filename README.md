### Info
This version of JSpin is launched in a low-res mode, to prevent cursor misalignment on retina screens.

### How to install
First run the following:
```
mkdir ~/jspin
cp -r jspin-examples bin ~/jspin
```

Inside the jspin.app there exists a config.cfg.
You need to change the directory in the two keys `SPIN` and `SOURCE_DIRECTORY` to your username inside this file.
